# Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt theorem

## Project Topic

In this project, we aim to formalize the Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt theorem, which ultimately serves to give a basis for the universal enveloping algebra for a given Lie algebra.

## Background

The universal enveloping algebra is used to understand representations of a given Lie algebra. Directly, we consider a representation as a bilinear map g X V -> V such that [X,Y].v = X.(Y.v)-Y.(X.v). If we consider the composition of representations as a representation of an element from the tensor algebra, as in (X tensor Y).v = X.(Y.v), then the set of all "actions" exists as the tensor algebra, up to the relation [X,Y] = X tensor Y - Y tensor X. If we quotient the tensor algebra by the ideal generated by this relation, we get the universal enveloping algebra. Thanks to this construction, the category of representations of a Lie algebra is isomorphic to the category of left modules of the associated universal enveloping algebra. 

Thus, if we can understand the structure of the universal enveloping algebra, we can understand the structure of representations of its Lie algebra. The Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt theorem states that the vector space structure of the universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra is isomorphic to the vector space structure of the symmetric algebra of a Lie algebra, with the two only differing by their algebra products. This isomorphism is constructed on the filtrations of these structures, where the nth filtration consists of the submodule of elements whose terms are the tensors of at most n elements.

## Definitions

A grading of a ring is a set of (necessarily abelian) groups indexed by a monoid, where the direct sum of all such groups is isomorphic to the additive group structure of the ring, and if we define a product on this direct sum by the isomorphism, then the product of an element in the ith group and an element in the jth group lies in the (i+j)th group. Algebras are graded as rings, forgetting their scalar multiplication structure. 

A filtration of an algebra is a set of subspaces of the vector space structure of the algebra indexed by the naturals (with zero), such that each subspace lies in the next, each contains {0}, the union of all subspaces is the entire algebra, and the product of an element in the ith subspace and an element in the jth subspace lies in the (i+j)th subspace.
